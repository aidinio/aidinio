- 👋 Hi, I’m Aidin
- 👀 I’m interested in everything programming! I'm currently focused on web development with Next.js, and developing a control center for the Awesome Window Manager, which instead of a polling approach, uses D-Bus to achieve more efficient event handling and emission.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FOSS projects, especially developing websites for them, with beautiful UIs.
